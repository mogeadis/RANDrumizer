## Description

### Project
**RANDrumizer** leverages an LSTM-VAE model to randomly generate symbolic drum patterns, each corresponding to a single 4/4 measure. While being a primitive neural network with limited performance, it serves as a functional demonstration of sequence generation in music, offering insight into how AI can create rhythmic structures despite its simplicity.

### Repository
The code in this repository is contained in a single *Jupyter Notebook*, namely [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb), which builds, trains and tests the neural network model. To demonstrate this process, a custom dataset provided in the [*Files*](Files) directory is utilized.

### Technical Details
This project was developed exclusively within the computing environment of *Google Colaboratory*, thus the specific version of *Python* used and any package requirements are subject to the up-to-dateness of the service at the time of development. To run the notebook in your own working environment, please refer to the associated code sections and make any necessary adjustments.
